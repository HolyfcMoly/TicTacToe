# Classic game TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game for two players in which the goal is to fill a line with three Xs or Os (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) to win. However, in this game, the player faces an AI opponent.

The AI has a well-thought-out logic and not only tries to prevent the player from winning, but also tries to win itself. Sometimes its moves can be more or less predictable, while other times it may "read" the player's moves and try to block lines to prevent a victory.
